# EX 51 C program to reverse a string.
## DATE: 15/05/2025
## AIM: 
To write a C program to reverse a string.

## Algorithm
1.Define a function reverse() that takes a string as an argument.
2.Find the length of the string.
3.Swap characters from both ends using a loop until the middle of the string is reached.
4.Use a temporary variable to hold characters during swapping.
5.Print the reversed string. 

## Program:
```
/*

Developed by: Mukesh Hs

*/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void reverse(char str[])
{
    int start = 0;
    int end = strlen(str) - 1;
    char temp;

    while(start < end)
    {
        temp = str[start];
        str[start] = str[end];
        str[end] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}

int main()
{
    char str[100];

    printf("Enter a string: ");
    fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin);

    // Remove newline character if it's read by fgets
    str[strcspn(str, "\n")] = '\0';

    reverse(str);

    printf("Reversed string: %s\n", str);

    return 0;
}
```
